<p>

  At startup a simple graphical interface (GUI in
 the following) appears. It is composed for the
 moment of the home, back, camera, parameters buttons along
 with a central list of buttons.

 Simply touch (click on a desktop) a button to navigate in
 the GUI. In general a button leads to sub lists that finishes
 with "leaves buttons" that permit to visualize something.
 For example :
@verbatim
     detector -> default
@endverbatim
 leads to a default layout view of the detector.

 The home button permits to return to the top
 list of buttons whilst the back button returns
 to the previous list. When visualizing something,
 the GUI disappears to let the place, full screen,
 to the "scene". A non visible "meta zone" exists
 at the bottom that permits, when touched (clicked on a desktop),
 to map again the GUI.

  When having a scene, the camera button permits to map
 a panel that let you move around the camera.

 As the general behaviour of the application is similar
 to the ioda application, we refer to <a href="http://ioda.lal.in2p3.fr" target="_top">ioda pages</a>

 for documentation about camera manipulation, producing
 output, about the document directory on a smart device, etc...
