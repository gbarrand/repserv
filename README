 To build :
          UNIX> cd ./inexlib/exlib/mgr
 [macOS,Linux]> ./build -v ../apps/repserv.cpp      # -v to see what is compiled. -x to have a full verbosity.
          UNIX> ./build ../apps/term_repserv_client.cpp

 (here UNIX is for Linux, macOS, Windows-10/cygwin, but repserv had not been ported on Windows-10/cygwin)

  If the GNU parallel application is known from your prompt, you can use the "-parallel"
 option so that C and C++ file compilations are distributed on your cores. This feature
 had been tested with success on macOS with a MacPorts installation of the GNU parallel program
 and on centos7 by using the GNU distribution. It clearly boosts the build of the ourex externals.

 To run :
   ./bin_[gnu,clang]/repserv -verbose &
   host 0.0.0.0
   port 54123
   tnt::Tntnet.run() ...

   ./bin_[gnu,clang]/term_repserv_client
   repserv> ls
   repserv> pwd
   repserv> exit

 to specify another host (default is 0.0.0.0) and port (default is 54123) : 
   ./bin_[gnu,clang]/repserv -host=<ip> -port=<num_port>

 To unfold some "pyramids of fits" seen from TouchSky and accessed with the repserv :
   cd ../../../data/
   mkdir -p ~/Documents/repserv
   unzip -q M51_large.pfits.zip
   mv M51_large.pfits ~/Documents/repserv/.
 
 In TouchSky, to declare your repserv host :
   GUI> home -> file on repserv -> add
   GUI> <Enter a name, the ip, the port> and then Ok.
   GUI> home -> file on repserv -> save
 or add/complete the file : ~/Documents/Touchsky/srvs with :
   <srvs>
    <srv>
      <name>My computer</name>
      <host>the ip</host>
      <port>the port</port>
    </srv>
    ...
   </srvs>
 When done in a way or another, to see the M51_large pyramid :
   GUI> home -> Some pimg -> Set host -> <choose your host>
   GUI> home -> Some pimg -> M51_large

 For LAL wall getting .pfits on ubuntu OpenStack 134.158.75.40 :
   ./bin_gnu/repserv -port=23541 -verbose
